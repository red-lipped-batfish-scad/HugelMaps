<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great user generated marketplaces available on GitHub; however, we didn't find one that really suited our needs so we created one for the permaculture community. We want to create a user generated marketplace that'll be the one stop shop for the permaculture community to give suppplies, sell equipment, and ask questions.

Here's why:
* Rather than limit the garden to only one use, permaculture gardens employ a variety of uses
* A permaculture garden provides food and medicinal crops, wildlife habitats, crafting materials, an attractive appearance, and a private, relaxing atmosphere throughout every season
* Create a garden that's unique to your own state and location! üå≥ üê¶

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Starting Notes
- Main branch is only for production
- Dev branch is for development. Two person review process for pull requests to the dev and main branch.

### Starting off
- [ ] 1. Clone main repository to local machine
- [ ] 2. git checkout -b [name/feature] -> Create feature branch off main or dev
- [ ] 3. Commit to your local feature branch often!

### Pushing changes to the main repo
- [ ] 1. 'Git checkout dev' (locally switch to dev branch)
- [ ] 2. 'Git pull origin dev' (Pull updates of dev down to your local system)
- [ ] 3. 'Git checkout [your branch] (switch back to your branch locally)
- [ ] 4. 'Git merge dev' (Brings dev into your local branch)
- [ ] 5. Resolve conflicts or :q if there aren't any
- [ ] 6. 'Git push origin <your branch>' (Push merged branch up to github)
- [ ] 7. Create a pull request in github from <your branch> ==> dev
- [ ] 8. Repeat as needed
- [ ] 9. When ready to publish main, do step 7 but from dev => main
  ```
  git checkout dev
  git pull origin dev
  git checkout <name/feature>
  git merge dev
  // Resolve Merge conflicts
  git push origin <name/feature>
  ```
